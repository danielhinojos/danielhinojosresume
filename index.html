        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Daniel HInojos Amaya. I went to Vista del Lago high school where I was one of the schoolâ€™s top students. I was ranked number 15 in the class of 2020. I used my time in high school taking AP and honors classes in hopes of going to college. I passed multiple AP exams, saving me money in college with those credits I earned. Also, I took honors classes to boost my G.P.A, allowing me to get accepted into every college I applied to, such as UC San Diego, UC Irvine, UC Riverside, and San DIego State to name a few.
<br><br>

        I also have plenty of experience working. My first job was at a fast food restaurant, where the fast paced environment helped me to create my work ethic. I need to ensure I work smart so the entire process and my coworkers will be able to efficiently get our tasks done. I also learned the importance of working in a team. Not everyone has the same background, so I learned that building interpersonal relationships with my peers will make the working environment better and create happy coworkers, and happy coworkers means a will run, great team. I worked in Fast Food while going to school, which provided me with a challenge. I decided to take this challenge to prepare myself for the future in college, where my work ethic will have to be adjusted.
<br><br>

        My next working experience was with Upward Bound Trio. This is a federal program designed for high school students that would help them excel in college and help them with college applications, scholarships, the FASFA, and provide them with extracurricular opportunities for career exploration. At this job, I worked with Trio to contact students and ensure our extracurricular activities would run smoothly. For example, I would have to contact colleges and help plan events so the colleges could create presentations so the students could learn about their colleges. I also had to create flyers using CANVA. These flyers would promote events or more complex projects. For example, I would set up interviews with students and staff so everyone in the program could get to know each other better. I designed the interview questions to capture the interests of the subject and help promote the past activities the program conducted so new students would have a better idea of what Upward Bound does and how it is a family. This job also gave me tutoring experience. Being a tutor is an incredible opportunity, as I get to learn how to put myself in another personâ€™s shoe so I can accommodate my teaching style to their needs.
